## Introduction to WebDriver Navigation
WebDriver provides various commands to navigate between web pages, interact with different windows, and control browser sessions. Understanding these navigation methods is crucial for handling dynamic elements and browser windows during automation.

## Navigational Commands in WebDriver

  Example:
  ```java
  driver.get("https://www.example.com");
